# Bash Language Server

Bash language server that brings an IDE-like experience for bash scripts to most editors. This is based on the [Tree Sitter parser][tree-sitter-bash] and supports [explainshell][explainshell], [shellcheck][shellcheck] and [shfmt][shfmt].

Documentation around configuration variables can be found in the [config.ts](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/blob/main/server/src/config.ts) file.

## Features

- Jump to declaration
- Find references
- Code Outline & Show Symbols
- Highlight occurrences
- Code completion
- Simple diagnostics reporting
- Documentation for symbols on hover
- Workspace symbols
- Rename symbol
- Format document

To be implemented:

- Better jump to declaration and find references based on scope

## Installation

### Dependencies

As a dependency, we recommend that you first install [shellcheck][shellcheck] to enable linting:
https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing . If `shellcheck` is installed,
bash-language-server will automatically call it to provide linting and code analysis each time the
file is updated (with debounce time of 500ms).

If you want your shell scripts to be formatted consistently, you can install [shfmt][shfmt]. If
`shfmt` is installed then your documents will be formatted whenever you take the 'format document'
action. In most editors this can be configured to happen automatically when files are saved.

### Bash language server

Usually you want to install a client for your editor (see the section below).

But if you want to install the server binary (for examples for editors, like helix, where a generic LSP client is built in), you can install from npm registry as:

```bash
npm i -g bash-language-server
```

Alternatively, bash-language-server may also be distributed directly by your Linux distro, for example on Fedora based distros:

```bash
dnf install -y nodejs-bash-language-server
```

Or on Ubuntu with snap:

```bash
sudo snap install bash-language-server --classic
```

To verify that everything is working:

```bash
bash-language-server --help
```

If you encounter installation errors, ensure you have node version 16 or newer (`node --version`).

### Clients

The following editors and IDEs have available clients:

- Atom ([ide-bash][ide-bash])
- Eclipse ([ShellWax](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/shellwax))
- Emacs ([see below](#emacs))
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) (built-in support)
- JupyterLab ([jupyterlab-lsp][jupyterlab-lsp])
- Neovim ([see below](#neovim))
- Sublime Text ([LSP-bash][sublime-text-lsp])
- Vim ([see below](#vim))
- Visual Studio Code ([Bash IDE][vscode-marketplace])
- [Oni](https://github.com/onivim/oni) ([see below](#oni))

#### Vim

For Vim 8 or later install the plugin [prabirshrestha/vim-lsp][vim-lsp] and add the following configuration to `.vimrc`:

```vim
if executable('bash-language-server')
  au User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({
        \ 'name': 'bash-language-server',
        \ 'cmd': {server_info->['bash-language-server', 'start']},
        \ 'allowlist': ['sh', 'bash'],
        \ })
endif
```

For Vim 8 or Neovim using [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe), add the following to `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:ycm_language_server =
            \ [
            \   {
            \       'name': 'bash',
            \       'cmdline': [ 'bash-language-server', 'start' ],
            \       'filetypes': [ 'sh' ],
            \   }
            \ ]
```

For Vim 8 or Neovim using [neoclide/coc.nvim][coc.nvim], according to [it's Wiki article](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers#bash), add the following to your `coc-settings.json`:

```jsonc
  "languageserver": {
    "bash": {
      "command": "bash-language-server",
      "args": ["start"],
      "filetypes": ["sh"],
      "ignoredRootPaths": ["~"]
    }
  }
```

For Vim 8 or NeoVim using [dense-analysis/ale][vim-ale] add the following
configuration to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:ale_linters = {
    \ 'sh': ['language_server'],
    \ }
```

#### Neovim

For Neovim v0.8:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
  pattern = 'sh',
  callback = function()
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = 'bash-language-server',
      cmd = { 'bash-language-server', 'start' },
    })
  end,
})
```

For NeoVim using [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim][languageclient-neovim], add the following configuration to
`init.vim`:

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'sh': ['bash-language-server', 'start']
    \ }
```

For Vim8/NeoVim v0.5 using [jayli/vim-easycomplete](https://github.com/jayli/vim-easycomplete). Execute `:InstallLspServer sh` and config nothing. Maybe it's the easiest way to use bash-language-server in vim/nvim.

#### Oni

On the config file (`File -> Preferences -> Edit Oni config`) add the following configuration:

```javascript
"language.bash.languageServer.command": "bash-language-server",
"language.bash.languageServer.arguments": ["start"],
```

#### Emacs

[Lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) has a built-in client, can be installed by `use-package`.
Add the configuration to your `.emacs.d/init.el`

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :commands lsp
  :hook
  (sh-mode . lsp))
```

Using the built-in `eglot` lsp mode:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package eglot
  :config
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((sh-mode bash-ts-mode) . ("bash-language-server" "start")))

  :hook
  (sh-mode . eglot-ensure)
  (bash-ts-mode . eglot-ensure))
```

## `shfmt` integration

The indentation used by `shfmt` is whatever has been configured for the current editor session, so
there is no `shfmt`-specific configuration variable for this. If your editor is configured for
two-space indents then that's what it will use. If you're using tabs for indentation then `shfmt`
will use that.

The `shfmt` integration also supports configuration via `.editorconfig`. If any `shfmt`-specific
configuration properties are found in `.editorconfig` then the config in `.editorconfig` will be
used and the language server config will be ignored. This follows `shfmt`'s approach of using either
`.editorconfig` or command line flags, but not both. Note that only `shfmt`-specific configuration
properties are read from `.editorconfig` - indentation preferences are still provided by the editor,
so to format using the indentation specified in `.editorconfig` make sure your editor is also
configured to read `.editorconfig`. It is possible to disable `.editorconfig` support and always use
the language server config by setting the "Ignore Editorconfig" configuration variable.

## Logging

The minimum logging level for the server can be adjusted using the `BASH_IDE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
and through the general [workspace configuration](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/blob/main/server/src/config.ts).
