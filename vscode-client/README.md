# Bash IDE

Visual Studio Code extension utilizing the [bash language server](bash-lsp), that is based on [Tree Sitter][tree-sitter] and its [grammar for Bash][tree-sitter-bash] and supports [explainshell][explainshell] integration.

## Features

- [x] Jump to declaration
- [x] Find references
- [x] Code Outline & Show Symbols
- [x] Highlight occurrences
- [x] Code completion
- [x] Simple diagnostics reporting
- [x] Documentation for flags on hover
- [ ] Rename symbol

## Configuration

To get documentation for flags on hover (thanks to explainshell), run the [explainshell Docker container][codeintel-bash-with-explainshell]:

```
docker run --rm --name bash-explainshell -p 5000:5000 chrismwendt/codeintel-bash-with-explainshell
```

And add this to your VS Code settings:

```
    "bashIde.explainshellEndpoint": "http://localhost:5000",
```

For security reasons, it defaults to `""`, which disables explainshell integration. When set, this extension will send requests to the endpoint and displays documentation for flags.

Once https://github.com/idank/explainshell/pull/125 is merged, it would be possible to set this to `"https://explainshell.com"`, however doing this is **not recommended** as it will leak *all your shell scripts* to a third party â€” do this at your own risk, or better always use a locally running Docker image.
