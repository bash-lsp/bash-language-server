# Bash Language Server

## 4.9.0

- Add more snippets and change their naming convention https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/805

## 4.8.4

- Make source error diagnostics ("Source command could not be analyzed") configurable with the `enableSourceErrorDiagnostics` flag.

## 4.8.3

- Skip sending a `client/registerCapability` request when dynamic capability registration is not supported by the client https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/763

## 4.8.2

- ShellCheck: avoid using the diagnostic tag "deprecated" that allow clients to render diagnostics with a strike through https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/753

## 4.8.1

- Ensure ShellCheck directive parse does not throw on malformed input https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/749

## 4.8.0

- Use ShellCheck directives when analyzing source commands https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/747

## 4.7.0

- Support for bash options auto completions when using Brew or when `pkg-config` fails, but bash completions are found in `"${PREFIX:-/usr}/share/bash-completion/bash_completion"` https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/717

## 4.6.2

- Remove diagnostics for missing nodes that turns out to be unstable (this was introduced in 4.5.3) https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/708

## 4.6.1

- Fix the ShellCheck code action feature that for some clients did not return any code actions. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/700

## 4.6.0

- Support parsing `: "${VARIABLE:="default"}"` as a variable definition https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/693

## 4.5.5

- Use sourcing info even if `includeAllWorkspaceSymbols` is true to ensure that files not matching the `globPattern` (and therefore not part of the background analysis) is still resolved based on source commands. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/695

## 4.5.4

- Skip running ShellCheck for unsupported zsh files. We will still try for files without a shebang and without a known file extension. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/694

## 4.5.3

- Fix issue where some features would work as expected in case of a syntax issue https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/691

## 4.5.2

- Skip completions in the middle of a non word when the following characters is not an empty list or whitespace. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/684
- Remove infrequent and rather useless "Failed to parse" diagnostics (and thereby the `HIGHLIGHT_PARSING_ERRORS` and `highlightParsingErrors` configuration option) â€“ the tree sitter parser is actually rather good at error recovery. Note that these messages will now be shown in the log. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/686

## 4.5.0

- Include 30 snippets for language constructs (e.g. `if`), builtins (e.g. `test`), expansions (e.g. `[##]`), and external programs (e.g. `sed`) https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/683

## 4.4.0

- Improve source command parser and include diagnostics when parser fails https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/673

## 4.3.2

- Improved CLI output https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/672

## 4.3.0

## 4.2.4

- Increase ShellCheck execution delay to 500ms after typing ends.

## 4.2.3

## 4.2.2

- Reduce CPU usage by introduce a short execution delay and throttling for ShellCheck tasks https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/655

## 4.2.1

- Add support for resolving loop variables https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/653

## 4.2.0

- Improve heuristic for resolving variables by taking the scope into account, both locally and when sourcing files. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/649
- Support client responding with `null` for `workspace/configuration`. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/650

## 4.1.3

- Correctly parse environment variable `BACKGROUND_ANALYSIS_MAX_FILES`, although clients should migrate to the new configuration system (see info in the 4.0.1 release). https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/640

## 4.1.2

- Correct ShellCheck `source-path` argument to support following sources based on the local folder of the file and the workspace root.

## 4.1.1

- Background analysis: handle workspace root being a URL https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/625

## 4.1.0

- Symbols across files are now only included based on sourced files (using non dynamic statements like `source file.sh` or `. ~/file.inc`) instead of including symbols from all files in the workspace. We now also support jump-to-definition on the file path used in a source command. The new behavior can be disabled by turning on the `includeAllWorkspaceSymbols` configuration option. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/244

## 4.0.1

- **Breaking**: Drop support for Node 12, which reached its official end of life on April 30th 2022. Doing so enables new features. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/584
- ShellCheck: support code actions, remove duplicated error codes, add URLs and tags, support parsing dialects (sh, bash, dash, ksh) but still fallback to bash, enable configuring ShellCheck arguments using the `shellcheckArguments` configuration parameter (legacy environment variable: `SHELLCHECK_ARGUMENTS`)
- Support workspace configuration instead of environment variables which enables updating configuration without reloading the server. We still support environment variables, but clients **should migrate to the new workspace configuration**. https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/599
- Allow disabling background analysis by setting `backgroundAnalysisMaxFiles: 0`.

## 3.3.1

- Fix missing documentation for some help pages https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/577

## 3.3.0

- Performant globbing and background analysis that should fix the server crashing for large workspaces. We currently limit the files parsed to 500, but can be configured using the `BACKGROUND_ANALYSIS_MAX_FILES` environment variable https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/569
- Enable ShellCheck integration to be disabled from the configuration. The default configuration used should be "shellcheck". https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/571
